# AchieveToDo

Forget about regular Minecraft. Welcome to a world where gameplay mechanics, food, items, and blocks require more from you! Created for crazy explorers of the cubic world, tired of monotony in progression and survival. Maximally close to the vanilla game.

This modpack is designed for single-player use only and is based on Minecraft 1.19.3 + ðŸ’œ [Sugar modpack](https://modrinth.com/modpack/sugar). Thank you for the great work on optimizing and enhancing the Minecraft experience!

Every world you create includes [BlazeandCave's datapack](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/blazeandcave-s-advancements-pack-1-12/) with over 1000 achievements. Your possibilities open up as your achievement counter grows. At the very beginning, you can't eat or even jump.

The pack adds an "AchieveToDo" tab to the achievements window. You won't know that a specific action is locked until you try to do it. When you attempt to do a locked action, a message will appear indicating the remaining number of achievements, and when you reach the required number of achievements, a notification will appear. So, from the very beginning, this tab looks like this:

BlazeandCave's is already configured to work with the pack, so you DO NOT need to access its settings through cheats. The default configuration has items and experience disabled and trophies enabled (this can be customized when creating a world in an upcoming update). The pack also includes a scoreboard on the right displaying the current number of achievements completed, which is necessary for the pack to function.

You can also create a hardcore world with BlazeandCave's datapack already included, which will be activated automatically.
