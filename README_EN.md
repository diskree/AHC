## AchieveToDo

Welcome to a world where game mechanics, food, items, and blocks will demand more from you! This is designed for those cube world explorers who are tired of the monotony in progression and survival. Here there are no new mobs, structures, or items - everything is based on vanilla mechanics.

Each world you create includes [BlazeandCave's](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/blazeandcave-s-advancements-pack-1-12/) with more than 1000 advancements.

### World Creation

A tab for AchieveToDo has been added to the world creation screen with settings:

![java_fv3uKVONsa](https://github.com/diskree/AchieveToDo/assets/96978370/ea1ac4cb-c082-46bb-8f27-b5368b32e5a3)

By default, you will only receive trophies for advancements. You can enable various items and increased experience, as well as custom generation from [StardustLabs](https://www.stardustlabs.net/). Settings can't be changed after creating the world.

Before creating the world, you will be asked to download the necessary datapacks, which depend on the settings of the world being created. This is, at the very least, the basic datapack BlazeandCave's for Survival mode. You need to download the file and drag and drop it to the Minecraft window, after which it will be processed and placed in cache. Subsequent worlds will be created without this requirement.

### Gameplay

Your capabilities in the game open up as you complete advancements. You can learn about available actions by opening the AchieveToDo tab in the advancement window:

You cannot know that a specific action is blocked until you try to perform it. For example, if you want to jump immediately after appearing in the world, you will see this:

After that, you can watch the progress of unlocking the action in the advancement window:

And when you get 7 advancements, jumps will open up and a message about it will appear:

![java_sUcsDl9pBD](https://github.com/diskree/AchieveToDo/assets/96978370/70848bab-d72b-4341-b9c1-1e236d817de6)

This will diversify your gameplay at the stage of initial and medium progression.

### Hints

It's hard to remember everything you've done in the world: places you've visited, things you've crafted, or mobs you've killed. However, there are more than 100 advancements that will make you remember something like this, or, in desperation, do everything all over again. To help find out what's left to do for such advancements, hints have been developed. I've left you a "Hintly Hallows" riddle and a branch of advancements in the AchieveToDo tab at the very bottom. A game mechanic awaits you inside, giving out holograms as a hint for a random advancement.

The first image symbolizes the tab from which the advancement was chosen, the second - symbolizes the advancement itself, and the third - the hint itself. For those advancements where you need to visit a certain place, a special spyglass has been invented that will be given to you instead of a hologram. I'm sure this will dilute the grind at the end that many are afraid of.

### Commands

The `/random` command outputs one of the uncompleted advancements in the chat. You can use it instead of viewing the advancement window, or to set a goal for yourself. Advancements with progress, as well as particularly difficult advancements, will not be offered.

### Advancement Window

- The window sizes have been increased for convenience.
- Tabs are grouped by meaning and are located on each of the 4 sides of the window with a fixed indent.

### Non-Vanilla Mechanics

- The Totem of Undying now only drops from the Evoker residing in the Woodland Mansion. I've decided to restore this mechanic by removing the totems from raiders to make gameplay more interesting.
- One of the vanilla blocks will appear in a place where you're not used to seeing it. This is part of a riddle, so I can't go into more detail.
- The game difficulty is automatically locked, so remember to choose the right one when creating the world.
- Cheats, creative mode, data packs, and world re-creation - all of this is either removed from the game or locked.

### Acknowledgments

- This is my first major Minecraft modding project. Moreover, it wouldn't have existed if Cavinator1 hadn't created the [BlazeandCave's advancement pack](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/blazeandcave-s-advancements-pack-1-12/), which greatly inspired me.
- Thanks to the [StardustLabs](https://www.stardustlabs.net/) team for their world generation for all three dimensions.
