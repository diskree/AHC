# AchieveToDo

Forget about the usual Minecraft. Welcome to a world where game mechanics, food, items and blocks familiar to all players will demand something more from you! Created for ardent explorers of the cubic world, who are tired of the monotony.

Only for singleplayer game! Each world you create includes a [BlazeandCave's datapack](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/blazeandcave-s-advancements-pack-1-12/) with 1000+ achievements. Your opportunities open depending on the achievements counter. In the beginning you can't even jump and eat. 

The modpack adds a "AchieveToDo" tab to the achievements window. You won't know what's blocked until you try something that's forbidden. When you reach the required count of achievements, an unlock notification will appear. From the beginning this tab will look like this:

BlazeandCave's is already configured to work with this modpack, so you DO NOT need to open its configuration using cheats. Achievement items off, experience and trophies - on. In the future, it will be possible to have more custom configuration when creating a world. Also, the scoreboard with the achievements counter is turned on automatically, this is necessary for the modpack to work.

You can also create a hardcore world, the corresponding datapack will be included automatically.
