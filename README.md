# AchieveToDo

Forget about the usual Minecraft. Welcome to a world where game mechanics, food, items and blocks familiar to all players will demand something more from you!

Each world you create includes a [BlazeandCave's datapack](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/blazeandcave-s-advancements-pack-1-12/) with 1000+ achievements. Your opportunities open depending on the achievements counter. In the beginning you can't even jump and eat nothing. 

The modpack adds a "AchieveToDo" tab to the achievements window. You will not know what is blocked until you try it. From the beginning this tab will look like this:

BlazeandCave's is already configured to work with this modpack, so you DO NOT need to open its configuration using cheats. Achievement items off, experience and trophies - on. In the future, it will be possible to have more custom configuration when creating a world. Also, the scoreboard with the achievements counter is turned on automatically, this is necessary for the modpack to work.

You can also create a hardcore world, the corresponding datapack will be included automatically.

This modpack require Minecraft 1.19 and last fabric version
This modpack is based on the ðŸ’œ [Sugar modpack](https://modrinth.com/modpack/sugar). Thanks for the work on the optimization and quality of the Minecraft game!
